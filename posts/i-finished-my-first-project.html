            <h1>I Finally Finished My First Project — And It Wasn't Perfect</h1>
            <p class="meta">February 26, 2026 • 6 min read</p>
            
            <p>For five years, I started projects. Websites, apps, side businesses — you name it, I started it. And every single one? Abandoned somewhere between 30% and 80% complete.</p>

            <p>I'd tell myself: "This time will be different. I'll finish this one."</p>

            <p>But I never did. Until last month.</p>

            <h2>What Changed Everything</h2>
            <p>I stopped trying to be perfect. Not "tried less" — I actively chose done over perfect. And something weird happened: I actually finished.</p>

            <h2>The Project That Finally Got Done</h2>
            <p>I built a simple productivity dashboard. Nothing fancy. Just a Notion template I'd been wanting to create for over two years.</p>

            <p>In the past, I'd have spent weeks on perfect colors, ideal user flows, and polished copy. This time? I gave myself 10 days. Not to make it perfect. Just to make it exist.</p>

            <h2>What I Did Differently</h2>

            <h3>1. I Set a Deadline, Not a Standard</h3>
            <p>Instead of "make it amazing," the goal was "finish by February 15th." A date. Not a quality bar. Deadlines force decisions. Perfection is infinite.</p>

            <h3>2. I Gave Myself Permission to Start Ugly</h3>
            <p>My first version had colors that didn't match, a broken button, and placeholder text everywhere. It was embarrassing. But it was done.</p>

            <h3>3. I Launched in Public</h3>
            <p>I told three friends I was doing this. Not "someday" — "this week." Accountability changes everything.</p>

            <h3>4. I Reframed "Failure"</h3>
            <p>If this flops, so what? I'd learn something. The worst case wasn't disaster — it was data.</p>

            <h2>What Happened Next</h2>
            <p>I launched on February 15th. Not perfect. Just out there.</p>

            <p>Within 48 hours:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>12 people signed up</li>
                <li>3 sent feedback</li>
                <li>1 became a paid customer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Not viral. Not life-changing. But real. And infinitely better than a perfect idea sitting in my head.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>

            <h3>Done creates momentum</h3>
            <p>Finishing that dashboard gave me energy for the next project. Now I've finished three things in a month — more than the previous two years combined.</p>

            <h3>Done gets feedback</h3>
            <p>Those three people who gave feedback? They told me exactly what to improve. I couldn't have known that without shipping.</p>

            <h3>Done builds identity</h3>
            <p>I'm now someone who finishes things. That's a different person than I was six weeks ago.</p>

            <h2>Your Turn</h2>
            <p>Whatever you've been putting off: do one imperfect thing toward it today. Not perfect. Just done.</p>

            <p>Hit publish. Send the email. Post the content. Launch the thing.</p>

            <p>Done beats perfect. Always.</p>
