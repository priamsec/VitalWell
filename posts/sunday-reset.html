            <h1>The Sunday Reset: 2-Hour Routine That Makes Your Week 10x Better</h1>
            <p class="meta">February 26, 2026 • 5 min read</p>
            
            <p>Sunday used to be my worst day. Not because of anything dramatic—just a slow, creeping dread of Monday. I'd spend the day either procrastinating on work I should do or feeling guilty for relaxing. Either way, I'd start the week exhausted before it even began.</p>

            <p>Then I built the Sunday Reset. Two hours. No stress. No complicated systems. Just a simple routine that helps me show up to Monday feeling actually ready.</p>

            <h2>Why Sunday Matters</h2>
            <p>Your Sunday sets the tone for your entire week. Not Monday—Sunday. Because by the time Monday arrives, it's too late. The question is already answered: are you walking into this week from a place of peace or panic?</p>

            <p>A good Sunday Reset does three things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clears mental clutter</strong> – Get the noise out of your head</li>
                <li><strong>Prepares practically</strong> – Set yourself up for an easy week</li>
                <li><strong>Restores energy</strong> – Recharge, not dread</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The 2-Hour Sunday Reset</h2>

            <h3>Hour 1: The Foundation (60 minutes)</h3>

            <h3>🧠 20 Minutes: Brain Dump</h3>
            <p>Get everything out of your head. Grab a notebook or open Notes app. Write:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What worked last week?</li>
                <li>What didn't work?</li>
                <li>What's on the calendar this week?</li>
                <li>What's worrying you?</li>
                <li>What do you want to accomplish?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't organize yet. Just dump. The goal is to get it out of your working memory and onto paper.</p>

            <h3>📋 20 Minutes: The Week Ahead</h3>
            <p>Now organize. Look at your dump and decide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Top 3 priorities for the week</li>
                <li>What's one thing you can delete from your plate?</li>
                <li>Schedule your workouts, meals, or self-care</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Block time on your calendar for the important stuff. Protect it like a meeting.</p>

            <h3>🏠 20 Minutes: Physical Reset</h3>
            <p>Tidy your space. You don't need a deep clean—just:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make your bed (yes, really)</li>
                <li>Clear the kitchen counter</li>
                <li>Throw in a load of laundry</li>
                <li>Prepare tomorrow's outfit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A clean space = a clear mind. It's not about perfection—it's about not waking up to chaos.</p>

            <h3>Hour 2: The Restoration (60 minutes)</h3>

            <h3>🍳 30 Minutes: Meal Prep Lite</h3>
            <p>You don't need to prep every meal. Just set yourself up for success:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard-boil eggs or prep overnight oats</li>
                <li>Wash and chop veggies for easy snacks</li>
                <li>Decide what you're eating for dinner Monday</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>😌 30 Minutes: Pure Restoration</h3>
            <p>This is non-negotiable. Do something that fills your cup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read a book (not work-related)</li>
                <li>Go for a slow walk</li>
                <li>Take a long bath</li>
                <li>Call a friend you haven't talked to</li>
                <li>Do absolutely nothing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No productivity. No self-improvement. Just being.</p>

            <h2>The Sunday Reset Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start after 9am</strong> – Sleep in. It's Sunday.</li>
                <li><strong>No work email</strong> – Really. Just don't.</li>
                <li><strong>No "shoulds"</strong> – Don't do anything out of guilt.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect this time</strong> – Treat it like a sacred appointment with yourself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Make It Your Own</h2>
            <p>The exact times don't matter. What matters is that you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear your head</li>
                <li>Prepare for the week ahead</li>
                <li>Rest without guilt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Start with 2 hours. See how you feel Friday. Then adjust. This isn't about perfection—it's about showing up to your life instead of just getting through it.</p>
