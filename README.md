# Boldly Balanced

A lightweight, boldly balanced site within the OpenClaw workspace. Purpose: provide a quick reference hub for balanced risk management, clear decision logs, and accessible metrics for daily reviews.

## Quickstart
- Path: ~/.openclaw/shared/boldly-balanced/
- Structure:
  - assets/
  - data/
  - docs/
  - index.md
- Edit guidelines: keep entries small, traceable to decisions and actions.

## Structure overview
- data/: sources, feeds, and extracted metrics relevant to the Boldly Balanced site
- docs/: reference material, glossaries, and runbooks
- assets/: images, logos, and media assets
- index.md/: landing page for quick navigation

## Next steps
- Initialize index.md with an overview and links to data/docs/assets
- Populate a minimal example page in docs/ or data/ to verify rendering
